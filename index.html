    <h1 class="first-header">Learn Basic HTML Coding with This Website!</h1>
    <p>
      This is a Website which will act as a guide, Helping you to Learn HTML.
    </p>
    <h2>What are the basics of HTML?</h2>
    <p>
      Before We get Into That, You must know the Full Form of HTML is
      <strong>H</strong>yper<strong> T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup
      <strong>L</strong>anguage. Remember That This is NOT a Programming
      Language. This is Called A Markup Language Because it Defines The Layout
      Of the Page, So that The Browser Can display it For You. HTML is NOT Case
      Sensitive, Meaning that it doesn't need a capital or small letter.
    </p>
    <h2>Starting Off:</h2>
    <p>
      There are a few Basic Commands That you need to learn about HTML. The
      Version Of HTML we Will be Using is HTML 5. This is the Latest Version
      Yet.
    </p>
    <p class="para-header">The<code> &lt;head&gt; </code>Tag</p>
    <p>
      The Head Tag Is the part of your website which is Visible just to you. It
      consists of the <code> &lt;Title&gt;</code> Tag, Which is the Name of your
      Website. This is displayed at the tab of your website, Which Is Above the
      URL Bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you make a Website, You should Experiment with the &lt;Title&gt; Tag as
      it gives you a better understanding of the use of the tag.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are interested to Learn more about this, Then I would recommend
      Checking The Assignment page which will help you to get practice in order
      to use these tags correctly.
    </p>
    <a href="#" id="assignment"> Assignments </a>
    <p class="para-header">The <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> Tag</p>
    <p>
      This is the Tag Which Which Makes the Content of the page. This is
      responsible for all the Text, Images, Links, etc. It is also responsible
      for The Main parts of your Website. Every little thing you do on the
      website is to be done in the body tag.
    </p>
    <p>Again, I have added An Assignment for this too.</p>
    <p class="para-header">
      The
      <code
        >&lt;h1&gt; &lt;h2&gt; &lt;h3&gt; &lt;h4&gt; &lt;h5&gt; &lt;h6&gt;
        Tags</code
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      These are the Tags Which Can form the first headers of these websites,
      From h1-h6, There are a huge number of difference changes which go like
      this:-
    </p>
    <h1>Text</h1>
    <h2>Text</h2>
    <h3>Text</h3>
    <h4>Text</h4>
    <h5>Text</h5>
    <h6>Text</h6>
    <p>
      You can use all these and can take advantages of their sizes. If you wish
      to have a custom size, You have to use a paragraph tag in that case. You
      will learn about it in some time.
