    <p>
      The Head Tag Is the part of your website which is Visible just to you. It
      consists of the <code> &lt;Title&gt;</code> Tag, Which is the Name of your
      Website. This is displayed at the tab of your website, Which Is Above the
      URL Bar.

      If you make a Website, You should Experiment with the &lt;Title&gt; Tag as
      it gives you a better understanding of the use of the tag.
